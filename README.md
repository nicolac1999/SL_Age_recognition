### Age Classification: an IML approach

In this project we would like to propose a classification method that discriminates between
different age classes based on face image analysis and then study it in an Intepretable Machine
Learning perspective. The algorithm classifies subjects into 4 different age categories. We use
the UTKFace dataset and we based our preprocessing and features extraction phases on https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0031320314002945. A
Random Forest model has been used to classify the images. Finally, we use the SHAP library
for the interpretability of the modelâ€™s results.
